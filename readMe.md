# Web Development Project 2 - Probability FlashCards

Submitted by: **Mumtaz Fatima**

This web app has probability-themed flashcards. I'm taking a stats course this semester so I thought why not put the fundamental concepts on flashcards. Flashcards are known to help memorize content by spaced repetition and this was one way I could keep coming back to the concepts as I continued developing this app.

## Notes

Challenges encountered: Working with passing information from child to parent has been one of the most timeconsuming bit of this project. However, being able to finally wrap my head around it and implement it was pretty rewarding!
